----------LOGIC----------
  -- (How I created) --

1. USED CONTEXT TO FETCH THE ECOMMERCE DATA.
   IN CONTEXT,
    data --> array, that is ecommerce api data
    cart --> array of items
    orders --> array (orders' history)
    and functions to remover items from cart and more.

2. USED LOCALSTORAGE KEYS TO STORE USER DATA  i.e.
    'subscribers' --> array of object that stores all the user's infol
    'loggedInEmail' --> email of logged in user.

3. USED SEPARATE CONTEXT TO STORE (BOOLEAN) WHETHER USER IS LOGGED IN OR NOT.
